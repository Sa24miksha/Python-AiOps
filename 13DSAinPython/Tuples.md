Tuples

Catchy Point: “Immutable Lists” → once created, cannot be changed.

When to use:

Data that shouldn’t change → like coordinates, RGB values, database records.

Faster than lists for large data because immutable → Python can optimize memory.

Tuple methods:

.count(value) → count occurrences

.index(value) → first index of value
